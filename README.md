# CSC-4101: Programming Languages
**Course Description:** Principles of programming languages design; specification of syntax and semantics;
underlying implementation of block structured languages; dynamic memory allocation
for strings, lists, and arrays; imperative versus applicative programming; logic
programming; modern programming languages.

**Relative Topics:** 
* Compilation versus interpretation.
* Overview of compilation including lexical and syntax analysis, semantic analysis and intermediate code generation.
* Programming in a functional language, such as Scheme and ML.
* Specifying syntax using BNF regular expressions and context‐free grammars.
* Object lifetime and storage management including stack‐based allocation and heap‐
  based allocation.

**Programs:**
* Lexical Analyzer: Developed a lexical analyzer that identifies and tracks tokens in an instructor-created programming language.
* IEEE-754: Designed an IEEE-754 converter that takes user input and provides both 16-bit and 32-bit binary representations as output.
* Scheme: Created a Scheme program that converts infix expressions from user input into their corresponding prefix form.
