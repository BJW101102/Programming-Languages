# CSC-4101: Programming Languages
**Course Description:** Principles of programming languages design; specification of syntax and semantics;
underlying implementation of block structured languages; dynamic memory allocation
for strings, lists, and arrays; imperative versus applicative programming; logic
programming; modern programming languages.

The following topics were discussed in this course: 
* History of programming languages.
* Compilation versus interpretation.
* Overview of compilation including lexical and syntax analysis, semantic analysis and
intermediate code generation.
* Programming in a functional language, such as Scheme and ML.
* Specifying syntax using BNF regular expressions and context‐free grammars.
* Recursive descent parsing and parse trees.
* Data abstraction and object orientation.
* Design issues for object‐oriented languages.
* Binding times, static and dynamic scoping.
* Object lifetime and storage management including stack‐based allocation and heap‐
  based allocation.
* Types, type equivalence, conversion, casting, compatibility, coercion, and inference,
* Implementation of function calls, including static vs. stack vs. heap allocation of
  activation records, static and dynamic links, parameter passing, and closures.
* Garbage collection.
* Design issues for procedures, including generic procedures and exception handling.
* Logic programming.
